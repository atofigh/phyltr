1. Introduction
===============

PhylTr is a bioinformatics package for reconciliation of gene and
species trees with respect to gene duplications, lateral gene transfers
(a.k.a. horizontal gene transfers), and speciations. PhylTr was
designed, written, and is being maintained by Ali Tofigh
<alix.tofigh@gmail.com>.


2. Installation
===============

The PhylTr package uses the library NHparser for reading trees. You
should first compile and install NHparser before proceeding to compile
PhylTr. PhylTr also depends on the boost library, version 1.34 or
higher. You can obtain boost from http://www.boost.org.

The PhylTr package uses the GNU autotools for building and
installation. Please see the file INSTALL for general instructions. For
the impatient try

$ ./configure && make && make install

This will install the binaries in standard system locations (e.g.,
/usr/include and /usr/lib). If you do not have write permissions to the
system directories, you can install the binaries in a local directory of
your choice:

$ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/location && make && make install

Also, try

$ ./configure --help

for more information about setting environment and compiler flags. Use
the --with-boost and --with-NHparser options to help configure find the
boost and NHparser libraries if they are installed in non-standard
locations.


3. Usage
========

All programs in the PhylTr package assume that trees (both species and
gene trees) are rooted. Trees are read in Newick/New Hampshire
format. For example here is a species tree with 5 species:

(((s1, s2), s3), (s4, s5));

And here is a corresponding gene tree:

(((s1_1, s2_1), (s3_1, ((s4_1, s5_1), (s1_2, s2_2)))), s4_2);

To let the programs know which extant gene corresponds to which species,
a so called sigma file is needed that maps each gene name to a species name:

s1_1    s1
s2_1    s2
s3_1    s3
s4_1    s4
s5_1    s5
s1_2    s1
s2_2    s2
s4_2    s4

Assuming that the files stree, gtree, and sigma contain the species
tree, gene tree, and gene-to-species mapping defined above, we can run
the phyltr-dp program as shown below:

------------------------------------------
$ phyltr-dp stree gtree sigma
Transfer edges:	6
Duplications:	12
Number of losses: 2

Transfer edges:	6 10
Duplications:	
Number of losses: 1

Transfer edges:	9 10
Duplications:	
Number of losses: 1
------------------------------------------

In this case there are three most parsimonious reconciliations between
the trees. One with a single transfer edge, and two with two transfer
edges. The numbers after "Transfer edges:" and "Duplications:" refer to
the vertices of the gene tree. The vertices of the gene tree are
numbered postorder and from left to right, so that the left-most leaf
has number 0. The numbering can also be deduced by looking at the
newick-file and number the vertices from left to right. Below, the
numbers of all the vertices of the gene tree have been added (in place
of edge-lenghts):

(((s1_1:0, s2_1:1):2, (s3_1:3 , ((s4_1:4, s5_1:5):6, (s1_2:7, 
s2_2:8):9):10):11):12, s4_2:13):14;

The program identifies a transfer edge using the vertex farthest away 
from the root. So, for example, in the first reconciliation, the 
transfer edge 6 refers to the incoming edge of the parent of s5_1.

There are two programs implementing two different algorithms for finding
reconciliations. phyltr-dp implements the dynamic programming algorithm
which finds the most parsimonious scenarios. phyltr-fpt implements the
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm which is able to also find
non-parsimonious scenarios. The fpt-algorithm will be noticably slower
for large instances. Do

$ phyltr-dp -h

and

$ phyltr-fpt -h

for help on command-line options, such as setting separate costs for
duplication and transfer events.

The programs phyltr-gen-stree and phyltr-gen-gtree are used to generate
species and gene trees using a stochastic birth-death process. See

$ phyltr-gen-gtree -h

and

$ phyltr-gen-stree -h

for more information.

Finally, the program phyltr-event-combination implements the parametric
algorithm, whose description is outside the scope of this small README
file. Hopefully, more documenation will be added soon.
